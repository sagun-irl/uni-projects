personal projects for uni

my (biased) ratings for the techs used:

tech         | rating  | review
------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------
Markdown     | `★★★★★` | just enough markup options, perfect for docs
JS (browser) | `★★★★★` | great, especially after es6
PHP          | `★★`    | old-school, lexical scoping is non-existent
MariaDB      | `★★★★`  | no pain-points overall
Tailwind CSS | `★★`    | i frown upon non-DRY code
Apache       | `★★★`   | can't specify server root, had to symlink `/htdocs`
